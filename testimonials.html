                We had an unusable corner in our living room. Johnny responded promptly, arrived on time, discussed our vision, and created attractive shelving within a week. Exactly what we wanted! We highly recommend.</p><br>

                I asked Johnny to build a catio. He responded quickly, designed it, sent updates and photos, built it in his workshop, and installed it in Torrievieja. Now my cats have a beautiful outdoor space they love. I’m really pleased with how it turned out!

                Johnny’s communication was excellent. He provided daily updates on which room he’d work in next, so I could prepare. His professionalism and work ethic were so impressive, I hired him twice more! I’m thrilled with his work and highly recommend him.
